# Semi-Supervised-Shenanigans
A series of semi-supervised learning activities.

This repo is desired to be a long series of semi supervised learning notebooks. In each notebook we take a labeled data set, throw the labels away, create our new labels through unsupervised means & then seeing what will happen.

This series was inspired by gaming serieses across the globe, as I believe that it is time tio have fun with our regular everyday activities including work. In such hard times of quaraentine such mentality is demanded.

This repo is empty at the moment but it will soon be updated with notebooks, each notebook represents an episode of the series with a different dataset to be experimented.
